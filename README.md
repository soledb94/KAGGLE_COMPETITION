Diamond Kaggle competition was a weekend class competition in wich we should predict the price of diamonds from its features, obtaining the less RSME as possible. In order to do that, We should train different regressions ML models to reach the less puntuation the better.

***

I developed a first models research from the regressions model I though with the characteristics of my problem it would be the best ones. I reached the followings puntuations(RSME):

From the results above, I decided to use some of that models to tunning the hyperparameters and find the best combination of them to obatain a better result.

After all the models were trained my two winners were:

ðŸ’Ž RANOMD FOREST REGRESSION (n_estimators=250)


ðŸ’Ž GRADIENT BOOSTING REGRESSOR (hipertunned)
